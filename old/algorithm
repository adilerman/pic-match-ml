Compare 2 images to see if they represent the same place.

1. Load the two images you want to compare.
2. Convert the images to grayscale.
3. Detect keypoints and extract descriptors using SIFT for both images.
4. Perform feature matching using a matching algorithm such as FLANN or brute force matching.
5. Filter out the good matches using a distance ratio test.
6. Extract the keypoint coordinates for the good matches.
7. Use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate the fundamental matrix.
9. Calculate the number of inliers
    (keypoint matches that agree with the estimated fundamental matrix) and outliers.
10. Set a threshold for the number of inliers to determine if the images represent the same objects.
11. If the number of inliers is above the threshold,
    conclude that the images represent the same objects.
    Otherwise, conclude they represent different objects.
